# Smart-Wastage-Classifier-System
## The Smart Wastage Classifier System is an innovative tool designed to classify waste items from uploaded images using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. It identifies categories such as plastic, paper, glass, and organic waste, providing users with classification results. Additionally, it generates approximate carbon footprint information for the identified waste type using Google's Generative AI, promoting environmental awareness. Built with Streamlit, the system offers an interactive web interface with a visually appealing design, including SDG goal visualizations.
